#js13kgames 2017 - lost

You are dropped in a wood/mountain area, or cave complex with a compass and some kind of weapon. The compass points to the way out. Certain minerals in the rocks completely fuck up the compass in those areas. Once you get out of one of those areas the compass is pointed a different direction. Compass is actually pointing to way points, once you pass through them, parts of the map change slightly to open or close off sections so you'll find ways where you are sure you've looked before. Once all way points have been activated (completely unbeknownst to the player) the exit will open... close to where you started because fuck you.

- controls, twin stick
- levels mostly randomly generated from preset chunks
- enemies will have movement types and weapon types so they can be combined to create unexpected enemies in each new area
